# DataMining
The DataMiningAlgorithms folder contains a collection of diverse Data Mining algorithms and techniques that I developed during my second year of undergraduate studies. Some of the algorithms featured are:

* SMOTE (including Tome Links removal) - **SMOTE_Algorithm**
* CURE - **CURE_Algorithm**
* Jaccard distance - **similar_items_Algorithms**
* MinHashing - **similar_items_Algorithms**
* Locality Sensitive Hashing - **similar_items_Algorithms**
* A-Priori algorithm - **frequent_items_Algorithms**
* PCY algorithm - **frequent_items_Algorithms**
